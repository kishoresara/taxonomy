Before entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a [[UEFA European Championship qualifying|qualifying process]]. Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's [[FIFA Confederations Cup]], but were not obliged to do so.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=95756/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712091406/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=95756/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 July 2012 |title=2005/2006 season: final worldwide matchday to be 14 May 2006 |website=FIFA.com |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association |date=19 December 2004 |access-date=13 January 2012}}</ref> From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the [[CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions]].

The sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] have each won three titles, [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[France national football team|France]] have won two titles, and the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]], [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.

The [[UEFA Euro 2020|most recent championship]], held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second [[List of UEFA European Championship finals|European title]] after beating [[England national football team|England]] in the [[UEFA Euro 2020 Final|final]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] in [[London]] on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Mustafa|first=DJ Kamal|date=12 July 2021|title=Italy wins on penalties UEFA EURO 2020 Final, Italy vs England highlights|url=https://emeatribune.com/italy-wins-on-penalties-uefa-euro-2020-final-italy-vs-england-highlights/|access-date=12 July 2021|website=EMEA Tribune}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=11 July 2021|title=Italy wins Euro 2020, beats England in penalty shootout|url=https://apnews.com/article/euro-2020-sports-soccer-europe-england-89bbc1c0ca45df053e30d7afcb13317e|access-date=12 July 2021|publisher=AP News}}</ref>

==History==
===Beginnings===
Regional tournaments for national teams existed before the advent of a truly pan-European competition. Starting in 1883, the [[British Home Championship]] was an annual competition contested between the [[United Kingdom]]'s four national teams, [[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]], and [[Ireland national football team (1882–1950)|Ireland]]. Until these national teams entered the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], it was the most important international tournament these nations competed in. Similarly, from 1927 until 1960, the [[Central European International Cup]] was held six times. It brought together the national teams of [[Austria national football team|Austria]], [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. The idea for a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by the [[French Football Federation]]'s secretary-general [[Henri Delaunay]] in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started, three years after Delaunay's death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1960/overview/index.html |title=Delaunay's dream realised in France |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=30 January 2012 |access-date=24 February 2012}}</ref> In honour of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/news/0258-0e51de1a172f-12472925ce41-1000--the-biggest-prize-in-2020/ |title=The Henri Delaunay Cup |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=28 January 2012 |access-date=24 February 2012}}</ref> The [[1960 European Nations' Cup|1960 tournament]], held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1960/teams/index.html |title=1960 UEFA European Championship – Teams |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |access-date=24 February 2012}}</ref> It was won by the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]], beating Yugoslavia 2–1 in a tense final in [[Paris]].<ref>{{cite web|date=1 October 2003|title=Ponedelnik heads Soviet Union to glory|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/news/0253-0d7b300e90b1-d0e35cbedac8-1000--ponedelnik-heads-soviet-union-to-glory/|access-date=26 February 2012|work=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations}}</ref> [[Spain national football team|Spain]] withdrew from its quarter-final match against the Soviet Union because of two political protests.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17680769 |title=Euro 1960: Lev Yashin leads Soviets to glory in France |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=11 June 2012 |first=Tom |last=Rostance |date=21 May 2012}}</ref> Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, the [[Dutch national football team|Netherlands]], [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] and Italy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/history/3078333.stm |title=France 1960 |date=17 May 2004 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=24 February 2012}}</ref>

The [[UEFA Euro 2012]] tournament was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=528963.html |title=EURO joy for Poland and Ukraine |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=19 April 2007 |access-date=10 January 2012}}</ref> Spain defeated Italy 4–0 in the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final|Final]], thus becoming the first nation to defend a European Championship title, as well as the first European team to win three consecutive major tournaments.<ref>{{cite web |title=Record-breaking Spain retain European title |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/731302/record-breaking-spain-retain-european-title |website=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |access-date=24 October 2021 |language=en |date=3 July 2012}}</ref> In scoring the third goal of the final, Torres became the first player to score in two European Championship finals. He was equal top scorer for the tournament with three goals in total, along with [[Mario Balotelli]], [[Alan Dzagoev]], [[Mario Gómez]], [[Mario Mandžukić]], and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], despite only being used as a substitute player. The tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a Euro tournament (26 out of 76 goals in total); a disallowed goal in the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Group D|England versus Ukraine]] group game which replays showed had crossed the goal line, and which prompted [[List of presidents of FIFA|President of FIFA]] [[Sepp Blatter]] to [[Twitter|tweet]], "GLT ([[Goal-line technology]]) is no longer an alternative but a necessity",<ref>{{cite web |title=Sepp Blatter confident of positive goal-line technology vote |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18520916 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=21 June 2012 |access-date=2 July 2012}}</ref> thus reversing his long-held reluctance to embrace such technology; and some crowd violence in group games.

===Expansion to 24 teams===

==Trophy==
[[File:UEFA Euro 2020 Trophy (cropped).jpg|thumb|200px|The trophy on display in 2021]]
The Henri Delaunay Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship,<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is the UEFA Euro 2024 trophy? |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/what-is-the-uefa-euro-2024-trophy-germany-henri-delaunay-cup-26610 |access-date=2024-03-21 |website=bundesliga.com - the official Bundesliga website |language=en}}</ref> is named in honour of [[Henri Delaunay]], the first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years before the first tournament in 1960. His son [[Pierre Delaunay|Pierre]] was in charge of creating the trophy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harrold|first=Michael|date=27 January 2006|title=You won't find a superior trophy|url=https://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=389177.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402065204/https://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=389177.html|archive-date=2 April 2013|access-date=13 January 2012|work=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|location=London}}</ref> Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning team for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament. This trophy bore the words ''Coupe d'Europe'' ("European Cup"), ''Coupe Henri Delaunay'' ("Henri Delaunay Cup"), and ''Championnat d'Europe'' ("European Championship") on the front and a juggling boy on the back.

For the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 tournament]], the Henri Delaunay Trophy was remodelled to make it larger, as the old trophy was overshadowed by UEFA's other trophies such as the new [[European Champion Clubs' Cup]]. The new trophy, which is made of sterling silver, now weighs {{convert|8|kg}} and is {{convert|60|cm}} tall, being {{convert|2|kg}} heavier and {{convert|18|cm}} longer than the old one. The marble plinth that was serving as base was removed. The new silver base of the trophy had to be enlarged to make it stable.

The players and coaches of the winning team and the runner-up team are awarded gold and silver medals, respectively. Each association that competes in the final tournament receives a commemorative plaque. Each time the team losing semi-finalist, as well as each finalist, receive a dedicated plaque. Though there is no longer a [[third place play-off]], UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2006/08 |url=http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/19079.pdf |publisher=UEFA |access-date=11 July 2016 |location=2.08 |page=3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031010220110/http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/19079.pdf |archive-date=10 October 2003 |url-status=live }}</ref> and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2010–12 |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/euro/91/87/57/918757_download.pdf |publisher=UEFA |access-date=4 July 2012 |location=3.08 |page=4 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215034039/https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/euro/91/87/57/918757_download.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.<ref name="regulations 2016">{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2014–16 |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/uefaorg/Regulations/02/03/92/81/2039281_DOWNLOAD.pdf |publisher=UEFA |access-date=2 September 2016 |location=4.08 |page=11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219025616/https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/uefaorg/Regulations/02/03/92/81/2039281_DOWNLOAD.pdf |archive-date=19 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-10-28 |title=SportMob – Everything you need to know about UEFA EURO history |url=https://sportmob.com/en/article/901356-everything-you-need-to-know-about-uefa-euro-history |access-date=2024-03-21 |website=SportMob |language=en}}</ref>

==Format==
===The competition===
Before 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.

In 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by [[Scotland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and the inclusion of [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]]. The new president of [[UEFA]], [[Michel Platini]], was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's executive committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7479293.stm |title=Uefa sets deadline over Euro 2012 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 June 2008 |access-date=13 May 2011}}</ref> On 25 September, it was announced by [[Franz Beckenbauer]] that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7636495.stm |title=Uefa to expand Euro Championship |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 September 2008 |access-date=13 May 2011}}</ref>

The competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in [[1960 European Nations' Cup|1960]] and [[1964 European Nations' Cup|1964]] through home and away [[Playoffs#Association football|play-offs]]; from [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968]] through a combination of both [[Tournament#Group tournaments|qualifying groups]] and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.

Since the expansion of the final tournament starting from [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]], the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.

In most tournaments, the tournament consists of a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] group stage followed by a [[single-elimination]] knockout stage.

Up to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.

No third place play-off has been played since 1980.

===Qualifying===
{{Main|UEFA European Championship qualifying}}
To qualify, a team must finish in one of the direct qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically.

The groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using [[Seed (sports)|seeding]]. Seeded teams include reigning champions and other teams based on their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams' abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:

# Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.
# Average goal difference.
# Average number of goals scored.
# Average number of away goals scored.
# Drawing of lots.

The qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For [[UEFA Euro 2020]], the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.

Each group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the [[UEFA Nations League]]. As with most leagues, [[Three points for a win|the points are awarded as three for a win]], one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:

# Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.
# Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.
# Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.
# Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.
# Results of all group matches:
## Superior goal difference
## Higher number of goals scored
## Higher number of goals scored away from home
## Fair play conduct.
# Drawing of lots.

===Final tournament===
[[File:UEFA European Championship best results.svg|500px|thumb|Map of countries' best results. 10 countries have won, counting Germany and West Germany as one. Dark gray means never qualified as an independent nation. Those with a white dot won with the Soviet Union in 1960. Some nations with a yellow square did not host a whole tournament but only one or more matches in the 2020 tournament.]]
Sixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 tournament]]. They were joint hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifying]]. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using [[UEFA coefficient|coefficients]] as a basis.

For the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.<ref name="regulations 2016"/>

The groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the [[FIFA World Cup]], this tournament no longer has a [[third place playoff]].
